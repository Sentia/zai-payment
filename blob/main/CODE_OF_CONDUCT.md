Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information (such as addresses or contact details) without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable conduct.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions (commits, issues, comments, etc.) that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  
Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
